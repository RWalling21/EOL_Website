Hi Mrs. Vaughan,
This project uses Node.js as a backend, so you can't just open the HTML file and view this
The website is not hard to view it might just take you a minute, here is how you view it.

Step 1: Install Node.JS here(https://nodejs.org/en/) select LTS
Step 2: Once node is installed, open a CMD and navigate to my projects folder (RHW_Evidence JS)
Step 3: Once there, type "npm install" you should see a progress bar, wait for it to finish
Step 4: Once the install is finished, type "npm start" wait for it to compile
Step 5: Node will start a server on your localhost, navigate to the link it gives you
Step 6: Enjoy the website :) if you have any problems just let me know 

The website is still in a very early version and will be coninually improved.
